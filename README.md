# Index-vs-Equity-Risk-Analysis
Measuring Risk in S&amp;P500 Index Equities vs Actual Index Benchmark

Financial data gathered through S&P500 Index tickers web scraped from Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_S%26P_500_companies), and data gathered through BatchGetSymbols() from https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BatchGetSymbols/BatchGetSymbols.pdf.
Risk-free Return data is US 1-year Treasury Bill web scraped from https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/pages/TextView.aspx?data=yieldYear&year=2020

Using standard financial risk assessment methods (cumulative returns, standard deviation, semi-deviation, downward deviation, beta, alpha, Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, Treynor Ratio), and statistical knowledge (random sampling, clustering, stratified sampling), we look at the differences in risk between the S&P 500 Index benchmark and selected equities over the current financial year.
